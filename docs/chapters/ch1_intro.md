# Chapter 1 – Introduction to ArmZilla

ArmZilla is a custom-built, ceiling-mounted robotic arm designed as a multi-purpose automation tool within **The Lab** ecosystem. Inspired by industrial robotics but adapted for creative and maker environments, ArmZilla combines precision, flexibility, and modularity to perform a variety of tasks – from 3D printer plate swapping to sorting small screws, and even mobile “follow-me” operation for interactive tasks.

## Why ArmZilla
- Part of the LANzilla/Fluxzilla family; themed, modular, automates workflows.
- Ceiling rail gives long horizontal reach without consuming bench or floor space.

## Key features
- Modular quick-change end effectors (gripper, vacuum tool, camera mount, optional engraver).
- Precision **ceiling rail** shuttle to serve multiple workstations.
- Payload capacity **up to 1 kg** for plate handling and tools.
- Vision integration (AprilTags, depth camera) for precise placement.
- Home Assistant integration for automations and UI on ZillaPad.
- Expandable: reuse parts from Ender-3/CR-10S + custom cycloidal gearboxes.

## Build philosophy
Hybrid approach using salvaged printer hardware and custom printed/CNC parts to keep costs down while enabling performance and the Portal-style aesthetic.
